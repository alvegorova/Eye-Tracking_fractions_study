# Math Anxiety, Performance, Executive Functions, and Effects of Perceptual Cues in Undergraduate Students

As we showed previously, in middle school kids, high math anxiety (MA) does not always coincide with low math performance (MP), and vice versa. In the current study I explored this association in older learners. A remote study on 117 undergraduate students from technical university showed that average levels of math anxiety are much lower in this population. However, medium levels of trait math anxiety was still reported by about two thirds of participants. Moreover, half of these students demonstrated good performance when solving math problems with fractions while performance of the rest of the higher anxious students was significantly poorer.

Following Processing Efficiency Theory (PET) and Attentional Control Theory (ACT) of anxiety and performance, I demonstrated that, while affecting only one medium-anxious group in performance, anxiety impacted solving efficiency of both medium-anxious groups. Thus, while both groups had to increase their effort, only in one group that increased effort was effective. Interestingly, those higher anxious groups did not demonstrate any difference in executive function skills which on average were higher compared to their age norms. This highlights the importance of searching for other internal mechanisms that can increase performance and efficiency of students with increased levels of math anxiety when they solve math problems. Finally, I explored specific types of external support that potentially target processing efficiency of students â€“ usage of perceptual cues in math problems. For this research question, I found limited evidence of impact on performance and efficiency, more research is needed to assess this and other types of interventions. 
My findings provide practical support and theoretical clarification for ACT and PET theories of anxiety. Moreover, it highlights the relevance of those theories and relationships for college-age students, underscoring the importance of creating different interventions addressing challenges that groups higher math anxiety experience when learning math.
